# This is me going over the course (workshop)

### "A Complete Intro to React"

https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-intro-react/

## My conclusion of the coures (workshop)
1. Brian Holt is great. It was a great course (workshop), and he gave it very well
2. Some of the featers, shown in the course used out dated packages (packages versions). took me some time to adjust my code.

realy recommend for all of you wanting to learn react + redux + react-router ...
